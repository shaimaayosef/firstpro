# Lvl1:
1. Write an algorithm to print all natural numbers from 1 to n. 

2. Write an algorithm to print all natural numbers in reverse from n to 3.Write an algorithm to print all the even numbers between 1 to 100. 

3. Write an algorithm to print all odd numbers between 1 to 100. 


# Lvl2:
1. Write an algorithm to count the number of digits in a number.

2. Write an algorithm to find the first and last digit of a number.
3. Write an algorithm that gets two positive integer numbers X and Y and calculates x*y Use only the addition and multiplication.

4. Write an algorithm to find the least number of terms that must be added to the following series 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2+5^2 to give a sum â‰¥ 10000



# Lvl3:

1. Write an algorithm that given two integer numbers, checks whether one number is a mirror of the other number. Hint: Use the reverse algorithm that you implemented in the previous question. Fun fact: In the Computer Science world, we call the concatenation of both numbers a Palindrome.

2. Write an algorithm that keeps on rolling two dice till both sides are equal.

3. This guessing game is a game where the program selects a random number between 1 and 10 and keeps asking you to guess, if you get it wrong you get a message informing you that you are a bad guesser, and then it asks you to guess again, if you guess right your program congratulates your player and exits the game loop. As an example assuming the program picked 6 as the secret number: The program prints Guess the right number: You enter 3.The program prints You guessed wrong XD:You enter 6. The program prints You did it, the correct number is 6.
