# what is nodejs?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript
on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight
and efficient, ideal for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
