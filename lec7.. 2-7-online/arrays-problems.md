# Arrays

## Lvl1:

1. Write an algorithm that reverses the order of elements of the given array.

2. Write an algorithm that inputs 10 numbers in an array using a for loop. 

3. Write an algorithm that inputs 10 numbers in an array using a while loop. 

4. Write an algorithm to print an array.


## Lvl2:
1. Write an algorithm to print an array in reverse.

2. Write an algorithm to copy all elements from an array to another array.

3. Write an algorithm to find the number of occurrences of an element in an array. Given the element and the array.

4. Write an algorithm to print all negative elements in an array.

5. Write an algorithm to find the sum of all array elements.

6. Write an algorithm to find the maximum and minimum element in an array.

7. Write an algorithm to find the second largest element in an array.


8. Write an algorithm to count the total number of even and odd elements in an array.
9. Write an algorithm to count the total number of negative elements in an array.

## Lvl3:


1. Write an algorithm that given an array of integers A moves all even elements in an array of integers to the front of the array and all odd elements to the rear. Hint: you do not have to maintain any order other than all events appearing before all odds in the array. For example: if the array is of the form [1,4,5,6,2,10] then the algorithm should create a new array of the form [4,6,2,10,5,1] and print the elements of the resulting array.

2. write an algorithm that sorts an array ascendingly .
